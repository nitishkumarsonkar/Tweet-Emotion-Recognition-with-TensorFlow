# Tweet Emotion Recognition

## Overview
Tweet Emotion Recognition is a machine learning project that utilizes deep learning techniques to classify emotions from tweets. The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features
- Preprocessing of tweet text data
- Emotion classification using deep learning models
- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model training
- Supports multiple emotion categories

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tweet-emotion-recognition.git
   cd tweet-emotion-recognition
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate or test the model:
   ```sh
   python evaluate.py
   ```
4. Predict emotions for new tweets:
   ```sh
   python predict.py --text "I am feeling happy today!"
   ```

## Dataset
You can use publicly available tweet datasets containing labeled emotions or create your own dataset. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed properly before training the model.

## Model
The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, padding, and embedding)
- LSTM/GRU layers for sequence processing
- Dense layers for classification
